The original __pycache__ could not be removed by the automated patch tool (binary .pyc files). You can safely delete the __pycache__ directory manually or run a powershell command:

# Delete __pycache__ recursively in this folder
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\__pycache__\

This file was created to indicate the cache was archived and should be removed in a follow-up manual step.
